# BaseShaders
A collection of base shaders that I use in Unity so I don't need to look up how to do everything

You can drop these in Unity's \Editor\Data\Resources\ScriptTemplates folder and then make them later based on what starting point you want for the shader you're making


If you want to learn more about shaders and see some good examples that I might have stolen some of my bits from, check out these places:
